## build:

Download it directly and extract it to any place of the computer. Open it with MATLAB and run. We tested it on MATLAB r2017a. 


## Run:

* run the localization method on a typical scenario:


```bash
    ./one_scenario/main.m
```

* run the localization in scenarios with different numbers of lamps:

```bash
    ./scenarios_analysis/main_lamps.m
```

* run the localization in scenarios with different numbers of lanes:

```bash
	./scenarios_analysis/main_lanes.m
```

* run the localization in scenarios with different numbers of trafficsigns:

```bash
	./scenarios_analysis/main_tfs.m
```
